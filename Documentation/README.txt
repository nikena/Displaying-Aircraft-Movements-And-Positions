Our Project

Our project - "Displaying Aircraft Movement and Poisitions" - is about mapping real world air traffic data
onto a 3D visualisation of the earth. This will require sourcing the data, building a program with which to view
the visualisation, and providing a smooth user experience for the end user.

Software/Hardware Requirements

There are no specific software requirements.
There are no specific hardware requirements, although a faster computer will run load a new data set faster.
