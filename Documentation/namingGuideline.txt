1.No Spaces in files or folder names
2.Try to keep to folder names in title case - e.g "ThisFolder" or "WorkForPlanes"
3.Try to keep to file names in camel case - e.g "exampleFile" or "planesAreCool"

4.Minutes filenames should be written as such
	4a. Group meetings = minutesGroup20_DD_MM
				e.g minutesGroup20_10_12
	4b. Supervisor meetings = minutesSupervisor20_DD_MM
				e.g minutesSupervisor20_10_12
